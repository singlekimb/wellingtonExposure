	<h3>What is this project about?</h3>
		<p id="about">
			<i>Wellington Exposure</i> in an interactive website which allows you to search through images of Wellington, NZ by colour. 
			My aim was to create a a website that would encourage locals to explore beyond their own neighbourhood and see what wonderful colours Wellington has to offer. I wanted the website to be a tool where people could step away from their digital devises and adventure outdoors with a purpose of seeing Wellington through the eyes of a photographer.
			Through this project I was also interested in exposing young, local artists of Wellington and introducing them to the wider community. I myself have a great interest in photography and have submitted my own photography to Wellington Exposure. Local artist are welcome to contact me to submit their own photography. I hope this project can grow and develop to produce many colourful archives of photography.
